This program is designed to consolidate workplans across different components of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics (www.gsars.org) into a single pdf report. 

Essentially, it fetches information from various Excel files spread over a common shared drive. Then the program does some formatting, and returns the information as LaTeX tables using Rmarkdown.
